# ESP32S3_I2C_Cluster

An ESP32S3 I2C cluster that captures WiFi beacon packets and outputs records that allow for a Network map to be drawn using the .dot processor. The cluster consists four nodes that each perform a specific function:

* Constant passive WiFi scaning to look for local netwoks (Node 0x56).
* Collection of WiFi beacon packets from any seen network (Node 0x55).
* Maps any found Mac addresses to vendor OUI (Node 0x57).
* (The master) polls each of the nodes for new data and outputs records accordingly.

Outside of my office window, I tend to see around 60 WiFi networks (Some hidden, some not). It's not much of a 
performance guide, but tests show the I2C bus and the nodes easily keep up with the beacon generation rate. 
Any drawn network diagrams tend to get bogged down with probes from rolling macs generated by mobile phones.
I tend to just filter these out (often by Vendor OUI).

Many of the domestic APs seem to offer multiple WiFi networks for roving users. These devices tend to use a rolling Mac
address that is similar to the advertised network's Mac. Where this is the case, the SSID for the roving network is
associated with the fixed Mac that relates to the visible home user SSID.
